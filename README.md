There are some basic operations that allow us to perform different actions on a stack.

Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it
